# Terraform GCP Test Environment
This config was vibe coded with Github Copilot Agent using Gemini 2.5 Pro (Preview). 
The structure is a little different than I would have done it, but it works and was a fun learning experience.

See the main `README.md` in the root directory for project overview and instructions.
